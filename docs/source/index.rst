Welcome to Distributed Consensus Algorithms
==============================================

The aim of this documentation is to guide you as a new joiner to the blockchain space in the understanding of 
one of the fundamental building blocks of any blockchain project, which is the Distributed Consensus Algorithm.

In distibuted computing, one fundental problem is to achieve overall system consensus, when sharing a commun 
ressource, even in the presence of faulty or maliciuous members. This problem have been first described as the **Byzantine
Generals Problem** by Leslie Lamport `et al` from the SRI Internation in 1982.
